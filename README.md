# Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/gdcef : 

  A Godot 3.5 GDNative plugin (C++) using Chromium Embedded Framework to allow you to add a web browser
  to your 2D or 3D applications. Initially made for the [Stigmee](https://github.com/stigmee) project but
  currently the most liked of all my projects ðŸ‘‹

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OffScreenCEF :

  Bind Chromium Embedded Framework with OpenGL and SDL. Proof of concept of feasibility binding CEF with
  the Godot Engine.

# System Modeling Tools

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Statecharts :

  A Python script parsing PlantUML statecharts (state machine) scripts and generating the C++ code with
  their unit tests.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/TimedPetriNetEditor :

  A graphical application and C++ library for editing (timed) Petri nets, (timed) graph events, and GRAFCET.
  This tool is coupled with (max,+) algebra and can be used with Julia.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MaxPlus.jl :

  Julia package allows you to do computations in the tropical algebra (max,+) and (min,+). An algebra where
  the plus and times operators are replaced by the maximum (minimum) and the plus operators. This algebra is 
  used in modeling discrete systems modeling synchronizations as linear systems. This project is a portage
  of the Scilab toolbox.

# City-based project

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Highway :

  An attempt at a C++ simulator for autonomous driving research.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OpenGlassBox :

  A C++ library implementing the SimCity v5 simulation engine.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimTaDyn :

  A C++ graphical standalone application manipulating geographic information systems like done with a spreadsheet.
This is an undone project, I learned back C++ with this project but as a noob, I made bad things. I shall clean it.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Ecstasy :

  3D project, made in Borland Delphi, of a city with its traffic jam. Vehicle dynamics. Student project.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/CiudadSim

  Scilab Traffic Assignment Toolboxes. (I'm not the original author).

# Predictions

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/GlobalWarming.jl :

  Basic signal processing in Julia about the global temperature to form my own opinion concerning climate warming.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/covid19.jl :

  Implementation in Julia of my father's COVID-19 epidemic model and prediction.

# Build system

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MyMakefile :

  A Makefile helper that I'm using for compiling all my C++ projects.

# C++ Libraries

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/zipper :

  A C++ library for zipping and unzipping. I'm not the original author but the project was
  abandoned by his author and this repo is a continuation.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OpenGLCppWrapper :

  A C++ library wrapping OpenGL Core profile routines. Based on the idea of Glumpy and Three.js
  projects.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimForth :

  C++ library for including a Forth interpreter inside your project.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Profiler :

  C++ header file for helping you to profile your code source. Based on the YouTuber TheCherno's idea.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/TerminalColor :

  C++ header file to allow you to print text in color on the console.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MyLogger :

  Basic C++ logger for my projects.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/LinkAgainstMyLibs :

  Continuous integration project for checking if my library project can
  be linked by an external project.

# Forth Interpreter

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimForth :

  My standalone Forth interpreter is mostly for learning and is used with SimTaDyn.
  It is slow and does not follow correctly the standard.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/GraphicsLessonInGforth :

  OpenGL and SDL tutorials for Forth. (I'm not the original author).

# Application projects

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/ChessNeuNeu :

  C++ and Julia project to make neural networks understand chess rules.
  Undone project.

- https://github.com/stigmee :

  A decentralized and open-source web browser and social network 3D.
  I initiate repositories, build systems, and CEF plugins for Godot. Afaik
  the project has stalled because the initial developers left the project
  (and so I am).

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/IslandedBrowser :

  Prototype of tool parsing your exported Firefox bookmarks and
  displaying them in 2D as a graph structure. Prototype for Stigmee project.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Speedway :

  My first 3D game was made in Borland Delphi as a computer science student.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/BacASable :

  Repo for testing stuff. I prefer grouping them inside a single repo
  than having several GIST files.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MySlides :

  The PDF documents I made when I was a computer science student (in French).

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/WebSiteGenerator :

  An HTML website generator based on GNU M4 macros. A saggy ancestor tool that is outdated by the Markdown language.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MyWebSiteSrc :

  The code source of my website is in M4 language and parsed by WebSiteGenerator.
