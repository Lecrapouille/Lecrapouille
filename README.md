# Tools based on Chromium Embedded Framework

- https://github.com/stigmee :

  A decentralized and open-source web browser and social network 3D.
  I initiate repositories, build systems, and CEF plugins for Godot. Afaik
  the project has stalled because the initial developers left the project
  (and so I am).

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/gdcef : 

  A Godot 3.5 GDNative plugin (C++) using Chromium Embedded Framework to allow you to add a web browser
  to your 2D or 3D applications. Initially made for the Stigmee project.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OffScreenCEF :

  Proof of concept of feasibility binding Chromium Embedded Framework with OpenGL and SDL before porting
  it is for Godot (gdcef project). 

# State machine, Petri tools

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/TimedPetriNetEditor :

  A graphical application and C++ library for editing (timed) Petri nets, (timed) graph events, and GRAFCET.
  This tool is coupled with (max,+) algebra and can be used with Julia.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Statecharts :

  A Python script parsing PlantUML statecharts (state machine) scripts and generating the C++ code with
  their unit tests.

# Dynamic system toolboxes

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MaxPlus.jl :

  Julia package allows you to do computations in the tropical algebra (max,+) and (min,+). An algebra where
  the plus and times operators are replaced by the maximum (minimum) and the plus operators. This algebra is 
  used in modeling discrete systems modeling synchronizations as linear systems. This project is a portage
  of the Scilab toolbox.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MP

  Backup of Jaroslaw Stanczyk's (max,+) Algebra Toolbox for Matlab.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/NSP
- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/ScicosLab

  Backup of official Scilab/Scicos forked projects developed at INRIA but no longer maintained and no longer
  compilable. (I'm not the author).

# Dynamic system simulations

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/covid19.jl :

  Implementation in Julia of my father's COVID-19 epidemic model and prediction.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/GlobalWarming.jl :

  Basic signal processing in Julia about the global temperature to form my own opinion concerning climate warming.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Janus :

  N-body anti-Newton galaxy simulation (Jean-Pierre Petit Janus model).

# City-based simulations

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/CiudadSim

  Backup of the Scilab Traffic Assignment Toolbox. (I'm not the author).

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Highway :

  An attempt at a C++ simulator for autonomous driving research. Undone project!

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OpenGlassBox :

  A C++ library implementing the SimCity v5 simulation engine.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimTaDyn :

  A C++ graphical standalone application manipulating geographic information systems like done with a spreadsheet.
This is an undone project, I learned back C++ with this project but as a noob, I made bad things. I shall clean it.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Ecstasy :

  3D project, made in Borland Delphi, of a city with its traffic jam. Vehicle dynamics. Student project.

# Build system

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MyMakefile :

  A Makefile helper that I'm using for compiling all my C++ projects.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/LinkAgainstMyLibs :

  Continuous integration project for checking if my library project can
  be linked by an external project.

# C++ Libraries

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/zipper :

  A C++ library for zipping and unzipping. I'm not the original author but the project was
  abandoned by his author and this repo is a continuation.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MQTT :

  A C++ MQTT client class wrapping the mosquito C-lib.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OpenGLCppWrapper :

  A C++ library wrapping OpenGL Core profile routines. Based on the idea of Glumpy and Three.js
  projects. Undone project!

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Profiler :

  C++ header file for helping you to profile your code source. Based on the YouTuber TheCherno's idea.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/TerminalColor :

  C++ header file to allow you to print text in color on the console.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MyLogger :

  Basic C++ logger for my projects.
  
# Forth Interpreter

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimForth :

  My standalone Forth interpreter is mostly for learning and is used with SimTaDyn.
  It is slow and does not follow correctly the standard. Undone project!

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/GraphicsLessonInGforth :

  OpenGL and SDL tutorials for Forth. (I'm not the original author).

# IA

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/ChessNeuNeu :

  C++ and Julia project to make neural networks understand chess rules.
  Undone project.

# Prototypes

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/IslandedBrowser :

  Prototype of tool parsing your exported Firefox bookmarks and
  displaying them in 2D as a graph structure. Prototype for Stigmee project.

- https://github.com/Lecrapouille/BacASable :

  Repo for testing stuff. I prefer grouping them inside a single repo
  than having several GIST files.

# Students projects
